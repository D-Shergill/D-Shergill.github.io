Call me *Ishmael*.  Someyears ago-*never midn how long precisely*-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particualr to interest me on shore, I though tI wold sail about a little and see the watery part of th eworld.  It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the ciruclation.

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin wraehosues, and brining up the rear of every funeral I meet; and espeicaly whenever my hypos get such an uper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principla to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking peopels hats off-then, I accoutn it high time to get to sea as asoon as I can.  This is my subsitute for pistol and ball.

With a philospghical florish Cato throws himself upon 
is sword; I quately take to the ship.  There is nothign surprising in this.
If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, 
cherish very nearly the same feeling towrads the ocean with me.
